# 📚 Text Splitting in LangChain

Text Splitting is the process of breaking down **large blocks of text** (e.g., articles, HTML pages, books 📖) into **smaller, manageable pieces (chunks)** 🧩 that a Language Learning Model (LLM) can handle effectively.

> ✅ **Large Text → Split into Chunks**

---

## 🧠 Why Do We Split Text?

1. **📏 Model Limitations**
   - Most **LLMs and embedding models have a maximum token/input size limit**.
   - Without splitting, we **can’t process long documents**, making the model miss context or truncate the content.

2. **🚀 Boosting LLM Tasks**
   - Text Splitting helps improve nearly **every LLM-powered task**, like:
     - Q&A systems
     - Summarization
     - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
     - Search, Chatbots, and more!

3. **💻 Optimize Resources**
   - Processing smaller chunks:
     - Uses **less memory**
     - Enables **faster computation**
     - Supports **parallel processing**

## 🧩 Types of Text Splitting in LangChain

LangChain offers multiple **strategies to split** text based on your needs:

### 1️⃣ Length-Based Splitting ✂️

- Splits text into chunks based on **character count, token count, or word count**.
- Example: Splitting every 500 tokens.
- 🔁 Can include some **overlap** to maintain context.

> ✅ Useful when structure doesn't matter, just need manageable chunk sizes.

---

### 2️⃣ Text Structure-Based Splitting 📄

- Splits using **natural separators** in the text like:
  - Paragraphs (`\n\n`)
  - Sentences (`.`)
  - Headings (`###`)
- Maintains more **readable and logical chunks** than plain length-based methods.

> ✅ Ideal for articles, blogs, and readable content.

---

### 3️⃣ Document Structure-Based Splitting 📑

- Leverages **document-specific formatting or tags**, like:
  - HTML tags (`<p>`, `<div>`)
  - Markdown structures (`##`, `-`)
- Maintains **hierarchical structure**, important for preserving meaning.

> ✅ Great for PDFs, websites, structured reports, etc.

---

### 4️⃣ Semantic Meaning-Based Splitting 🧠

- Uses **embeddings** or **language understanding** to split at **semantic boundaries**.
- Keeps **meaningfully related sentences** together in a chunk.
- Tools like [Chunkviz](https://chunkviz.up.railway.app) can visualize and optimize such chunks.

> ✅ Best for deep tasks like summarization, QA, and retrieval systems.

## 🛠️ Tools/Library Support

LangChain provides several classes to help with text splitting:

- `CharacterTextSplitter`
- `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`
- `TokenTextSplitter`
- `MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter`
- `HTMLHeaderTextSplitter`
- `SentenceTransformersTextSplitter` (semantic-based)

---

## 🔁 Common Parameters in Text Splitters

- `chunk_size`: Maximum size of a chunk
- `chunk_overlap`: Number of tokens/characters to overlap between chunks
- `separators`: Characters to split on (`["\n\n", "\n", ".", " "]` etc.)

---

## 💡 Example Use Case: RAG Pipeline

Imagine building a **chatbot with RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):

1. 🔍 You upload a long PDF.
2. 🧩 Text is split into meaningful chunks.
3. 📚 Each chunk is embedded into vector DB.
4. 🤖 When user asks a question, relevant chunks are retrieved and passed to LLM.

No splitting? ❌ You’ll miss context or fail due to token limits.

# 📌 How to Fine-Tune Large Language Models (LLMs)?

Fine-tuning is the process of adapting a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) to perform better on a specific task or domain. It involves training the model on task-specific data while adjusting only certain parameters to enhance efficiency. Fine-tuning improves accuracy, reduces inference costs, and customizes responses based on specialized needs.

Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) allows us to adapt them for specific tasks, improving accuracy, efficiency, and relevance. In this guide, we'll explore different fine-tuning methods, including PEFT and LoRA, and provide a Python demo. 🚀

## 1️⃣ Why Fine-Tune an LLM? 🤔

Fine-tuning LLMs is essential for:
✅ Adapting the model to domain-specific tasks (e.g., medical, legal, or finance applications).
✅ Reducing inference costs by making the model more efficient.
✅ Improving accuracy on specialized datasets.
✅ Enhancing the model’s ability to follow specific instructions.
✅ Customizing model responses to align with brand voice or company guidelines.

## 2️⃣ Full Fine-Tuning vs. Partial Fine-Tuning ⚖️

### 🏆 Full Fine-Tuning (FFT)

✅ Adjusts all parameters of the model.
✅ Requires large computational resources.
✅ Achieves high-quality adaptation but is expensive.
✅ Demands a large labeled dataset.

### 🎯 Partial Fine-Tuning (PFT)

✅ Only modifies a subset of parameters (e.g., adapter layers or LoRA parameters).
✅ More memory and compute efficient.
✅ Suitable for task-specific or low-resource settings.
✅ Often used in conjunction with PEFT (Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning).

📊 **Comparison Table:**

| Feature          | Full Fine-Tuning (FFT) | Partial Fine-Tuning (PFT) |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Compute Cost     | High                   | Low                       |
| Data Requirement | Large dataset          | Small dataset             |
| Model Adaptation | High                   | Moderate to High          |
| Training Time    | Long                   | Short                     |
| Memory Usage     | High                   | Low                       |

## 3️⃣ Options to Fine-Tune an LLM ⚙️

1. **Full Fine-Tuning** – Updates all model weights, requiring extensive resources.
2. **Partial Fine-Tuning** – Uses techniques like LoRA and PEFT to fine-tune only a subset of parameters efficiently.

---

## 4️⃣ Understanding PEFT and LoRA 🛠️

**PEFT (Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning)** and **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** are efficient ways to fine-tune LLMs without updating all parameters.

---

## 5️⃣ Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) 🔍

PEFT is a set of techniques to fine-tune LLMs efficiently:
✅ Reduces memory footprint.
✅ Freezes most model parameters, updating only a few.
✅ Includes LoRA, Prefix-Tuning, and Adapter Layers.
✅ Works well for low-resource environments.

Common PEFT Methods:

- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Injects small trainable matrices into model layers.
- **Adapters**: Small task-specific layers added to transformers.
- **Prompt-Tuning**: Adjusts input embeddings rather than model weights.

---

## 6️⃣ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) 💡

LoRA is a method of fine-tuning by injecting low-rank trainable matrices into specific model layers.
✅ Requires fewer trainable parameters than FFT.
✅ Reduces GPU memory usage.
✅ Ideal for deploying LLMs in production.

📊 **PEFT vs. LoRA Comparison:**

| Feature            | PEFT              | LoRA             |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Parameter Update   | Selective         | Very Selective   |
| Memory Usage       | Low               | Lower            |
| Training Speed     | Fast              | Faster           |
| Model Adaptability | High              | Moderate         |
| Ideal For          | Various scenarios | Resource-limited |

### Which is Better? 🏅

🔹 **If you need high adaptability**, use **PEFT**.
🔹 **If you have limited GPU resources**, go for **LoRA**.

### Conclusion 🏁

✅ Both methods improve efficiency, but **LoRA is preferred for resource-limited setups**.
✅ **PEFT is a broader approach** that includes LoRA.

## 7️⃣ Python Demo: Fine-Tuning Using LoRA 🐍

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model
import torch

# Load base model & tokenizer
model_name = "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, device_map="auto")

# Define LoRA configuration
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    r=8,
    lora_alpha=32,
    lora_dropout=0.1,
    target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"]  # Only fine-tune attention layers
)

# Apply LoRA
model = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)
model.print_trainable_parameters()

# Prepare dataset (example)
dataset = [
    {"input": "What is the capital of France?", "output": "Paris"},
    {"input": "Who wrote Harry Potter?", "output": "J.K. Rowling"}
]

def tokenize_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples["input"], padding="max_length", truncation=True)

# Training (example stub, actual training setup requires Trainer API)
trainer.train()

# Save fine-tuned model
model.save_pretrained("./fine_tuned_model")
```

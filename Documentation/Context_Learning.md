# 🧠 **In-Context Learning (ICL) & Prompt Engineering**

## 1️⃣ **In-Context Learning (ICL)**

### 🔍 **Definition**

In-Context Learning refers to a model’s ability to learn and generate relevant responses **without explicit retraining** by understanding examples given **within the prompt itself**.

### 📌 **Key Features**

- No need for model retraining.
- Uses past interactions and examples to generate context-aware responses.
- Works based on **few-shot**, **one-shot**, or **zero-shot** learning.
- Relies on the model’s inherent **pretrained knowledge**.

### 📂 **Types of In-Context Learning**

| 🏷 Type                    | 📝 Description                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Zero-Shot Learning** 🤖 | The model generates an answer without any example. It relies on pre-trained knowledge.  |
| **One-Shot Learning** 🎯  | The model is given **one** example to guide its response.                               |
| **Few-Shot Learning** 📚  | The model is given **multiple** examples to improve accuracy and context understanding. |

# 🛠️ Tools in LangChain — Detailed Notes

## 1. What is a Tool? 🤔

A **Tool** in LangChain is simply a **Python function** (or an object) that is **packaged** in a way that an **LLM** (Language Model) can **understand, reason about, and call** when needed.

Think of it like:
- 🧠 **AI Agent** → 🤔 **Reasoning & Decision Making** → 🛠️ **Calls the Tool** → 🎯 **Takes Action**

🔹 **Purpose of Tools**:
- Execute tasks
- Fetch data
- Perform calculations
- Interact with external systems (APIs, databases, etc.)

An **AI Agent** autonomously **thinks, decides, and uses tools** to achieve a goal! 🚀

---

## 2. Built-in Tools 📦

Built-in Tools are **predefined, production-ready tools** that **LangChain provides out-of-the-box**.

✨ **Key Points**:
- No need to write your own logic! 🛋️
- Just **import and use** them directly.
- Examples include search engines, file handlers, etc.

⚡ **Example**: 
```python
from langchain.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchTool
```
and it's ready to go!

## 3. Custom Tools 🛠️

Custom Tools are tools that **you define yourself** to handle **specific or business-specific needs**.

🔹 **When to create Custom Tools**:
- You want to call **your own APIs** 🔗
- You want to **encapsulate custom business logic** 🧩
- You want the LLM to **interact with your app, database, or product** 🗄️

In short, **when built-in tools aren't enough**, you create your own!

---

## 4. Ways to Create Custom Tools 🏗️

LangChain offers **3 main ways** to create tools:

### ➡️ 1. Using `@tool` decorator 🖊️

Quick and simple way!

Example:
```python
from langchain.tools import tool

@tool
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

---

### ➡️ 2. Using `StructuredTool` & Pydantic 📋

Use **StructuredTool** when your tool **needs structured inputs**, like multiple fields or strict typing.

- Define input schema using **Pydantic models**.
- Great for complex functions! 🚀

Example:
```python
from langchain.tools import StructuredTool
from pydantic import BaseModel

class InputSchema(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int

def process_user(data: InputSchema) -> str:
    return f"User {data.name} is {data.age} years old."

tool = StructuredTool.from_function(process_user)
```

---

### ➡️ 3. Using `BaseTool` 🧱

- **BaseTool** is the **abstract class**.
- All other tool types (`@tool`, `StructuredTool`, etc.) are **built on top of BaseTool**.
- Use when you need **full flexibility and control** over the tool's behavior. 🛠️

Example (advanced):
```python
from langchain.tools import BaseTool

class CustomTool(BaseTool):
    name = "custom_tool"
    description = "A tool that returns a custom message."
    
    def _run(self, input_text: str):
        return f"Processed input: {input_text}"
    
    async def _arun(self, input_text: str):
        raise NotImplementedError()
```

---

## 5. Toolkit 🎒

A **Toolkit** is simply a **collection of related tools** bundled together for **easy reuse**.

🔹 **Purpose**:
- Group tools that serve a **common goal**.
- Example: Managing files, handling emails, interacting with cloud storage, etc.

📚 **Example**: `GoogleDriveToolkit`
- Contains tools like:
  - `upload_file`
  - `download_file`
  - `list_files`

All neatly packaged to interact with **Google Drive**! 📂✨

| Concept | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tool** | A callable function the LLM can use |
| **Built-in Tool** | Pre-made by LangChain |
| **Custom Tool** | Defined by you (using `@tool`, `StructuredTool`, or `BaseTool`) |
| **Toolkit** | A bundle of related tools |
